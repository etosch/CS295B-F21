                <h1 id="course-project-g">Course Project (G)</h1>
<p>Only graduate students are required to complete a course project. In the <a href="#content">Content</a> section I will provide two suggested topics. You may also propose your own. Expect this document to be updated periodically throughout the course.</p>
<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>
<h3 id="workshops">Workshops</h3>
<p>On workshop days, your presentation may take a variety of forms, including but not limited to:</p>
<h4 id="initial-project-presentation">Initial Project Presentation</h4>
<p>Every person/group will present (&lt; 10 mins). At this point, you will have received feedback from me and should be able to identify the relevant systems, tasks, and environments under study, as well as the major research question you will address. </p>
<h4 id="presenting-related-material">Presenting related material</h4>
<p>On days marked "Workshop" one group/person will present. Early in your project work, you may want to focus on presenting related work that helps to contextualize what you are doing. This is the sort of material you might cite in an introduction, background section, or related work section of paper. Earlier in the semester, this work will likely focus on justifying your project as research, establishing the problem space as relevant and open. By mid-semester, you will be sufficiently into the details of your work that you may want to spend time during class giving background on a critical method. For example, if your work relies heavily on agent-based simulation, you might want to use this time to present agent-based simulation as an evaluation tool.</p>
<h4 id="presenting-current-progress">Presenting current progress</h4>
<p>You may present your progress on a variety of tasks, including but not limited to software infrastructure or corpora that you are building, findings such as empirical analyses or proof results, or reports on challenges you are facing. You may be asked during your presentation how this work relates to your motivating research question; be prepared to answer. </p>
<h4 id="presenting-negative-results">Presenting negative results</h4>
<p>You should feel free to present any negative results; this may range from experiments that failed to disprove hypotheses to engineering approaches that failed to do the thing you'd hoped they'd do. I would encourage you to use class time to work through any of these problems with the class, and to try to brainstorm alternative approaches. </p>
<h3 id="group-members">Group members</h3>
<p>You may work with a partner on your project, but not in groups of more than two. You may optionally include any number of undergraduates on your project and they will not count towards your group size. </p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>We will discuss specifics of content during the project presentation day (see <a href="#schedule">the schedule</a>). Your project proposals will have two major components: a topic or system you propose to study and a set of three possible research questions you'd like to answer bu the end of the semester. My feedback will focus on two things: (1) whether the topic is within scope of the course and (2) whether your research questions are sufficiently scoped. </p>
<p>I will circulate two example topics (one on instrumenting an existing system for experimentation and one on designing crowdsourcing systems) along with a list of research questions. You should feel free to use the examples as your project, or riff on them. I do not require the projects be unique. </p>
