Course Description In this course we will discuss software as a data collection platform. We will investigate methods for designing software systems that directly support sound data collection and analysis. We will contrast this with conducting data collection and analysis over \u201cfound\u201d systems and contextualize e.g., verified software as a method for mitigating statistical, selection, and measurement biases. This course will double as a research methods for computer science course. Students will practice identifying research questions and hypotheses and discuss both empirical and theoretical methods for validating hypotheses. After the initial course introduction (i.e., first two weeks of the course), meetings will be structured as follows: Mondays will be lectures, which will give broader context to the two weekly readings, presented on Wednesdays. Friday meetings will vary, consisting of project reports, discussion, and lectures on as as-needed basis. There are no exams, programming assignments, or problem sets in this course.

In the Content section I will provide two suggested topics. You may also propose your own. Expect this document to be updated periodically throughout the course. Logistics Workshops On workshop days, your presentation may take a variety of forms, including but not limited to: Initial Project Presentation Every person/group will present (< 10 mins). At this point, you will have received feedback from me and should be able to identify the relevant systems, tasks, and environments under study, as well as the major research question you will address. Presenting related material On days marked \"Workshop\" one group/person will present. Early in your project work, you may want to focus on presenting related work that helps to contextualize what you are doing. This is the sort of material you might cite in an introduction, background section, or related work section of paper. Earlier in the semester, this work will likely focus on justifying your project as research, establishing the problem space as relevant and open. By mid-semester, you will be sufficiently into the details of your work that you may want to spend time during class giving background on a critical method. For example, if your work relies heavily on agent-based simulation, you might want to use this time to present agent-based simulation as an evaluation tool. Presenting current progress You may present your progress on a variety of tasks, including but not limited to software infrastructure or corpora that you are building, findings such as empirical analyses or proof results, or reports on challenges you are facing. You may be asked during your presentation how this work relates to your motivating research question; be prepared to answer. Presenting negative results You should feel free to present any negative results; this may range from experiments that failed to disprove hypotheses to engineering approaches that failed to do the thing you'd hoped they'd do. I would encourage you to use class time to work through any of these problems with the class, and to try to brainstorm alternative approaches. Group members You may work with a partner on your project, but not in groups of more than two. You may optionally include any number of undergraduates on your project and they will not count towards your group size. Content We will discuss specifics of content during the project presentation day (see the schedule ). Your project proposals will have two major components: a topic or system you propose to study and a set of three possible research questions you'd like to answer bu the end of the semester. My feedback will focus on two things: (1) whether the topic is within scope of the course and (2) whether your research questions are sufficiently scoped. I will circulate two example topics (one on instrumenting an existing system for experimentation and one on designing crowdsourcing systems) along with a list of research questions. You should feel free to use the examples as your project, or riff on them. I do not require the projects be unique.","title":"Course Project (G)"},{"location":"course_project.html#course-project-g","text":"Only graduate students are required to complete a course project.

Undergraduates may earn up to 3 points for scribing lectures or project workshops/presentations. At present, I do not plan to have students scribe paper presentations, but if this turns out to be a lively class and there is demand, that may change. Why scribe? In many classes, students copy down from the board what the professor writes...which come from the professor's notes. Why not just give students those notes? There are several objectives, including but not limited to: (1) controlling the rate of information flow, (2) ensuring each step is clear, allowing students to ask clarifying questions, and (3) encouraging students to engage with the material in detail, in real time. When you elect to scribe for this course, it means you will engage with the course material in a detailed, systematic fashion. Scribing is not transcription; as a student, you should view scribing as part of a pedagogical toolkit. How to scribe Scribing should happen in two phases: during the first phase you will be taking contemporaneous notes and during the second phase you will write up your notes. Phase 1: Taking notes Taking notes is hard! It is especially challenging in classes that are discussion-based, where multiple people may be talking at once, and where conversations may happen at a much faster speed than lecture. When taking notes, do not expect you will be able to participate at the same level of engagement as you would, were you not taking notes . Do, however, feel empowered to interrupt whenever you miss something . Handwriting vs. Typing You are free to whatever medium for note-taking works best for you. If you do not consider yourself to be a good note-taker, consider using scribing to try out different methods of note-taking to see what works best for you. Anecdata: I, personally, have always struggled with note-taking. I never looked back at my notes and never understood the purpose. It was not until the middle of graduate school until I learned to take notes as a way that worked for me: I would just write what I heard and generally not look at what I was writing. This meant that early on I had a lot of typos and portions of my notes that were effectively illegible. Eventually, they started to look like this . I also found it helpful to share my note document with someone as I was typing to help check my understanding live. You can see an example of this here , where my then-advisor responded to my notes in real time. I will allow up to two students to scribe per-meeting; if you find that paired note-taking works well for you, feel free to employ this method. On the use of recording devices You may use recording devices to aid in your note-taking. However, this is very likely to end up being more work than taking contemporaneous notes! Phase 2: Writing up notes To reiterate: scribing is not transcription! While it is possible to take notes in a way that ends up differing very little from its final form, I expect most students to see a signficant change from their raw notes to the final version. Write-ups will be due by 11:59pm on the day you scribe, throughout September. The purpose of this deadline is twofold: It ensures that you re-engage quickly. It ensures that you don't spend a long time on write-ups. It gives me time to give you feedback during September . During September, I will be giving feedback on scribed notes by 9am the next day . You will have the opportunity to re-submit your notes after receiving feedback before 11:59pm on the next day (i.e., the same day I submit feedback) to improve your grade. In October , we will move to having notes due at 11:59pm on the day after you scribe . In summary: September : Suppose you take notes on a Monday . You must submit your notes that evening, by 11:59pm. I will provide feedback before 9:00am on Tuesday . If you score a 3, excellent! If you score lower than a 3, I will provide suggestions to improve your score. You can then choose to implement them and if you do, submit your revision by 11:59pm on Tuesday . October : Suppose you take notes on a Monday . Then you should submit your notes by 11:59pm on Tuesday . Note: Late notes will not be accepted. There is no grade penalty for not submitting your notes . If you fail to submit your notes and do not have the usual documentation (i.e., medical or personal reasons), you will be de-prioritized for future scribing. For what your final form should look like, see the section on how you will be graded . How to submit your notes There will be entries in Blackboard for you to submit your notes. This will be listed as an assignment for everyone, but I will only grade those who have volunteered to scribe. I will set up submission entries for each week no later than Sunday night of that week. Notes should be in pdf format, written in LaTeX. I have written a template on Overleaf to help you get started. You can either create an Overleaf account and copy this template, or download and compile LaTeX locally. If you are new to LaTeX, I recommend the former. How you will be graded Scribe notes will be graded on completeness , correctness , and legibility . I do not expect you to produce transcriptions, but I do expect some narrative structure; the Overleaf template contains more detailed information on what this looks like. Scribe notes with egregiously incorrect information cannot be distributed and will result in a grade of 0. If there is factually incorrect information in the notes, I will ask you to either correct them or remove them. If I've asked you to correct them, but you do not have time to do, I recommend merely removing those sections. If you receive less than full credit for your notes, I will give you concrete feedback on how to revise your notes to earn full credit. What happens with your scribe notes If you receive a grade on your notes greater than zero, I will post your notes in Teams and Blackboard so that the class may use them. I will also post an anonymized version of your notes on this website.","title":"Scribe Guidelines (U)"},{"location":"scribe_guidelines.html#scribe-guidelines-u","text":"Scribing is an undergraduate-only course component.

It is normal for graduate students in computer science to refer to graduate faculty by first name, but due to the mixed enrollments of this class, I would prefer the more formal \"Prof. Tosch.\" Please do not refer to me as \"Ms. Tosch,\" and especially not \"Mrs. Tosch.\" While the rules for address in academia are complex and political , refraining from these two is one of the few near-universal norms. TA(s) : There are no TAs, nor course assistants for this course. Timing Meeting times and location MWF 12pm-12:50pm, Innovation E204 Student hours (Office hours) In person : Mondays, Innovation Hall E456 Virtual : Wednesdays, MS Teams Hybrid : Thursdays, Innovation Hall E456 and MS Teams I am also available over MS Teams chat (may not be synchronous), and by appointment with 24hrs notice . Unless you wish to discuss a sensitive issue, please post any questions to the appropriate Teams channel; it is likely that more people will be interested in your question or observation than you realize! Modality This course provides in-person instruction only. In the event that we move to online instruction by university mandate, we will use the provided MS Teams Team . Please be advised that MS Teams is not fully functional on *Nix operating systems. Please ensure you familiarize yourself with the available technical support for students . If you need a suitable device for fully participating during a stay-at-home order, please contact UVM IT and your advisor for help acquiring a suitable device. Platforms and Software This course will be taught entirely in-person; participation via discussion will be a central feature. We will be using the following tools and technologies: Blackboard For graduate students, Blackboard will be used as a portal for important links (i.e., those listed below), for displaying grades, and for occasional polling. Undergraduate students will use Blackboard to hand in their scribed notes. Hotcrp (pronounced \u201chot crap\u201d) will be used for paper bidding, reviews and discussion. Hotcrp is a real-world conference management system used widely in the systems community. Hotcrp is also approved for educational use. If you do not have a hotcrp account before the end of the first week of classes, please email Emma.Tosch@uvm.edu to be added. The course website will hold the schedule and a copy of the information in this syllabus. Copies will live on Blackboard and Teams, but this website should be considered the most up-to-date. A Github organization will be used to manage projects. MS Teams will be used for group chats. If the university mandates remote instruction, we will meet on Teams. Mask Policy All students are required to wear masks during class, regardless of vaccination status or state/university policy, until notified otherwise. This follows standard masking protocol . Pre-requisites Hard pre-requisite Graduate standing or evidence of computing maturity; I will grant an override to any interested undergraduate in good academic standing. Soft pre-requisites Many of the readings for this course are drawn from the systems, programming languages (PL), software engineering (SE), and databases (DB) literature. Therefore, a background in one of these areas (e.g., a course in PL, SE, operating systems, distributed systems, database systems, applied formal methods, or some professional software development experience ) may aid in understanding course readings and allow the student to spend fewer hours on reading and responses. The focus of this course is applying methods from these background areas to pressing data collection problems. Therefore, an interest in domain-specific problems in more data-intensive fields ( data science, machine learning, computational social science ) can be just as beneficial as a background in the technical methods. I expect any motivated student to be able to excel in this course Attendance Policy and Classroom Environment Expectations This course follows standard attenance policy guidelines . Participation will be not be graded, but all students are strongly encouraged to ask questions and engage with the material during class time. Students may also engage with reviews through the commenting feature in hotcrp. Course Content Course Learning Objectives After completing this course, students should have a holistic view of the modern data collection pipeline for the purpose of knowledge discovery. Students will be able to identify the major open research problems in this domain. This course will also introduce students to the professional standards and tools of the computer science systems community. Finally, this course will double as a research methods course, meaning that we will include discussion of what constitutes a research question, falsifiable hypotheses, and the various methods for evaluating systems that process both machine- and human-generated data. Readings and Reviews Readings must be done by 11:59pm the night before classes are due. This will give me sufficient time to read your reviews and comment on them. Some readings may take significant time, so please plan accordingly. You may want to start your readings the weekend before they are due. Presentations Students will be assigned to present 1-2 papers. Nearly every career path requires strong communication skills, and public presentations are one way to develop these skills. You should take extra time to research the background of the paper you are presenting. We will discuss the qualities of a good presentation during class. Undergraduates may swap their presentations, so long as they inform me ahead of time. Graduate students must present at least once. Grading Criteria/Policies and Assessments Undergraduate Credit Undergraduates will be graded on a points-based system: Letter Grade Points A 93-100 A- 90-92 B+ 87-89 B 83-86 B- 80-82 C+ 77-79 C 73-76 C- 70-72 D+ 67-69 D 65-66 F Below 65 There are more than 100 points total available: There will be 20-30 readings throughout the semester. Students will enter reviews each week. Each review is worth up to 3 points. Students will enter reviews into hotcrp. Students will be required to present at least one, but no more than two, papers per semester. Students may choose to swap assignments and should let me know at least six hours before class. One student may negotiate with another to present their assigned reading, resulting in more than two presentations, so long as both parties consent. Each presentation is worth up to 10 points. Undergraduates may volunteer to scribe lectures (at most 2 scribes/lecture) and project workshops . Scribing is more than note-taking ; each document is worth up to 3 points and you will have the opportunity to improve your notes for more points. Notes should be typed up in LaTeX . Undergraduates may join a graduate project , however joining a project will result in no numeric credit. Thus, there are two ways to earn an A+: Earn over 100 points. Join and contribute to a graduate project AND earn \u201cA\u201d grade via the points system (i.e., 93 + project = A+) Graduate Credit The goal of the graduate section of this course is to provide structure to guide early-stage research projects and lay the foundation for a future publication. In most computer science domains, this means you will be doing preliminary work for a top-tier conference submission (equivalent to a top journal submission in other fields). My hope is that by the end of the semester, you have enough work for an initial workshop paper (or conference, if your subfield ranks journals higher). Therefore, graduate students will be evaluated thusly: Component Percentage Project 50% Presentations 30% Reviews 20% My goal is to ensure that this course is not overly onerous for graduate students and that you are able to make research progress. During my first year of graduate school, Hanna Wallach gave me (and other new graduate students) this paraphrased advice: Aim for the minimum passing grade, plus some epsilon correlated with how much you want to impress the professor. If you consistently earn higher grades, people will wonder why you weren't spending more time on research. Unfortunately, this advice is hard to take in practice, so I will make things easier for you: I want to be able to give you all As. 1 Show up, participate, put them time in and be good citizens, and you will pass the course with flying colors. If you are having a hard time keeping up, communicate issues early and often . This class will certainly be work , but it should not be a distraction . That said, sometimes other courses are overly demanding and this creates an arms race for your time. Therefore, if I must provide a breakdown of how you will be graded for the presentations and reviews, it would shake out like this: You will be graded on your presentation using the same criteria as the undergraduate students. Graduate students who present more than once can have their second presentation substitute in for three reviews. Reviews will be graded pass/fail. Passing critieria is equivalent to the criteria to be used for undergraduates achieving 3/3 points on their reviews. Your total review grade will be the percentage of \"passed\" reviews. How would I prefer to grade things? I'd prefer if most people had high engagement most of the time. I'd prefer to not have to police the occasional late review and instead assume that everyone is participating in good faith, and that folks who miss a review will make it up later. Things happen; it's not the end of the world. However, if everyone fails to engage, the quality of the course will drop. Therefore, I will track graduate engagement and let the class know when things are slipping. Course Evaluation All students are expected to complete an evaluation of the course at its conclusion. Evaluations will be anonymous and confidential, and the information gained, including constructive criticisms, will be used to improve the course. I will not be giving out A+s to graduate students. \u21a9","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"syllabus.html#syllabus","text":"","title":"Syllabus"},{"location":"syllabus.html#course-logistics","text":"","title":"Course Logistics"},{"location":"syllabus.html#staff","text":"Instructor : Prof. Emma Tosch (she/her) - Emma.Tosch@uvm.edu During class, I prefer for you to address me as \"Prof. Tosch.\" \"Dr. Tosch\" and \"Prof. Emma\" are also fine, but the former feels overly formal to me and latter a little cute.
