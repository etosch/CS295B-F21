                <h1 id="uvm-resources">UVM Resources</h1>
<p>This page contains boilerplate resources for classes (i.e., this information is not specific to this course).</p>
<h2 id="technical-support-for-students">Technical support for students</h2>
<p>Students, please read this technology check list to make sure you are ready for classes.   </p>
<p>https://www.uvm.edu/it/kb/student-technology-resources/</p>
<p>Students should contact the Helpline (802-656-2604) for support with technical issues.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy-and-classroom-environment-expectations">Attendance Policy and Classroom Environment Expectations</h2>
<p>Attendance at every class is expected and students should familiarize themselves with the UVM attendance policy: </p>
<p>http://catalogue.uvm.edu/undergraduate/academicinfo/rightsandresponsibilities/  </p>
<p>If a student will not be able to attend in-person classes for qualifying health reasons, Student Health Services (SHS) will send a notification to the appropriate student services office or designated staff member informing them of this along with the dates the student is unable to attend.  The SHS notification will specify whether the request for flexibility is only around in-person class attendance or includes additional flexibility for assignments and tests because the student is too ill to participate. Students are responsible for working with their faculty to make up class content and work they miss due to a documented illness.</p>
<h2 id="mask-policy">Mask Policy</h2>
<p>UVM expects students, faculty, and staff to remain compliant with all COVID-19 recommendations and measures in place for UVM, the State of Vermont, and the City of Burlington. This includes following all rules regarding facial coverings when attending class and generally in indoor spaces. If you do not follow these guidelines, I will ask you to leave the class. If you forget your mask, you cannot enter the class and should go back and retrieve your mask. The Code of Student Conduct outlines policies related to violations of University policies that protect health and safety on campus.</p>
<h2 id="inclusion-statement">Inclusion Statement</h2>
<p>Our intention is for CEMS to be a place where you will be treated with respect and kindness.  We welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, interests, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability â€“ and other visible and nonvisible differences. All members of the College are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the community. If you ever feel that you have been unfairly treated or judged by an instructor, a mentor, another student, or another member of the CEMS community, please let someone know. Your instructors and advisors in the CEMS Office of Student Services are available to discuss any concerns or you can report an incident of bias through the Campus Bias Response Program.</p>
<h2 id="managing-your-identity-at-uvm">Managing Your Identity at UVM</h2>
<p>Students at UVM can specify the first name and pronoun they want used on campus. All students at the University of Vermont can indicate their preferred first name and pronoun to the University community regardless of whether or not they have legally changed their names. Choosing a preferred name in the BANNER system will automatically change which name appears in many internal locations such as class lists, grade reports, and unofficial transcripts. <br />
For more information on how to update your preferred name and personal pronouns as well as keeping your legal name private: </p>
<p>https://www.uvm.edu/registrar/preferred-name-and-pronoun </p>

Research and Citation Help<br />
For help selecting research topics, finding information, citing sources, and more, ask a librarian. The UVM Libraries are eager to help. You may ask questions by phone, e-mail, chat, or text, or make an appointment for an individual consultation with a librarian.<br />

<h2 id="intellectual-property-statementprohibition-on-sharing-academic-materials">Intellectual Property Statement/Prohibition on Sharing Academic Materials</h2>
<p>Students are prohibited from publicly sharing or selling academic materials that they did not author (for example: class syllabus, outlines or class presentations authored by the professor, practice questions, text from the textbook or other copyrighted class materials, etc.); and students are prohibited from sharing assessments (for example homework or a take-home examination).  Violations will be handled under UVMâ€™s Intellectual Property policy and Code of Academic Integrity. </p>

<h2 id="student-learning-accommodations">Student Learning Accommodations</h2>
<p>In keeping with University policy, any student with a documented disability interested in utilizing ADA accommodations should contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS), the office of Disability Services on campus for students.  SAS works with students and faculty in an interactive process to explore reasonable and appropriate accommodations, which are communicated to faculty in an accommodation letter. All students are strongly recommended to discuss with their faculty the accommodations they plan to use in each course. Faculty who receive Letters of Accommodation with Disability Related Flexible accommodations will need to fill out the Disability Related Flexibility Agreement.  Any questions from faculty or students on the agreement should be directed to the SAS specialist who is indicated on the letter. </p>
